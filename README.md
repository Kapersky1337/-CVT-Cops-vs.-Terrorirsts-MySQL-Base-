# -CVT-Cops-vs.-Terrorirsts-MySQL-Base-
A basic CVT gamemode, literally a base for newbies. This script can be the base of a very good TDM server, I prepared this for myself only, for a project. But, then I declined that project, and then I thought to release it. So, I'm contributing this gamemode, to SA-MP community, enjoy! I hope, people will use it. Many, many features "mSelection, textdraws etc..." you'll love it ;)
